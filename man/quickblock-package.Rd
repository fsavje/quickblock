\title{quickblock: Quick Threshold Blocking}
\description{
Provides functions for assigning treatments in randomized experiments using
near-optimal threshold blocking. The package is made with large data sets in
mind and derives blocks more than an order of magnitude quicker than other
methods.
}
\details{
See \code{\link{quickblock}} for the main blocking function.

See the package's website for more information:
