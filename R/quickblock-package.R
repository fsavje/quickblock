#' quickblock: Quick Threshold Blocking
#'
#' Provides functions for constructing near-optimal threshold blockings. The
#' package is made with large data sets in mind and derives blockings more than
#' an order of magnitude quicker than other methods.
#'
#' See the package's website for more information:
#' \url{https://github.com/fsavje/quickblock}.
#'
#' Bug reports and suggestions are greatly appreciated. They are best reported
